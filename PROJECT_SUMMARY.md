## 🎯 What's Working

### ✅ Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy**: ~74% on synthetic Titanic data
- **Features**: 7 input features (class, sex, age, siblings/spouses, parents/children, fare, port)
- **Status**: ✅ Trained and saved successfully

### ✅ Web Interface
- **Frontend**: Clean, responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Features**: Form validation, probability visualization, confidence scores
- **Status**: ✅ Working and accessible via browser

### ✅ API Server
- **Framework**: Flask with CORS support
- **Endpoints**: /predict, /health, /
- **Status**: ✅ Ready to run (start with `python app.py`)

### ✅ Netlify Deployment Ready
- **Static Version**: Self-contained HTML with client-side prediction
- **Algorithm**: Rule-based prediction capturing main survival patterns
- **Status**: ✅ Ready for instant Netlify deployment

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Local Development (Full ML Model)

1. **Start the API server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open web interface**:
   - Open `index.html` in your browser
   - Or visit `http://localhost:8000` if serving locally

3. **Make predictions**:
   - Fill in passenger details
   - Get ML-powered survival predictions

### Option 2: Netlify Deployment (Static Version)

1. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Upload `netlify-version.html` (rename to `index.html`)
   - Instant deployment with no server required

2. **Use the app**:
   - Enter passenger information
   - Get rule-based survival predictions

## 🎮 Demo the Application

### Test Data Examples:

**High Survival Probability**:
- Class: 1st Class
- Gender: Female
- Age: 25
- Siblings/Spouses: 0
- Parents/Children: 0
- Fare: £50
- Port: Cherbourg

**Low Survival Probability**:
- Class: 3rd Class
- Gender: Male
- Age: 30
- Siblings/Spouses: 0
- Parents/Children: 0
- Fare: £8
- Port: Southampton
